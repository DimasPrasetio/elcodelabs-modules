# Go Backend Standard

Read this together with [backend-modular-monolith.md](backend-modular-monolith.md) — the module boundary rules apply unchanged.

## Locked stack

```txt
Watcher          = Air                      (never `go run main.go`)
Migration        = golang-migrate
Database access  = sqlc
Driver           = database/sql + MySQL driver
ORM default      = NOT GORM
```

The generated `apps/api/cmd/server/main.go` loads `.env` via `github.com/joho/godotenv`
(`../../.env` first, since the API runs from `apps/api` while `.env` lives at the repo root;
then a local `.env` as fallback — errors from both are ignored, since in a container env comes
from `env_file`). Run `go mod tidy` once after scaffolding to resolve `go.sum`.

`migrate:up`/`migrate:down` run through `scripts/migrate.mjs`, a dependency-free Node wrapper
around the `migrate` CLI. This is deliberate: npm runs scripts through `cmd.exe` on Windows,
which does not expand `$DATABASE_URL`, so a literal `-database "$DATABASE_URL"` argument
fails there. The wrapper reads `DB_DSN` from `.env` itself and passes it through explicitly,
working the same in PowerShell, cmd, and sh.

Rules:

- Use `golang-migrate` for migrations.
- Use `sqlc` for type-safe DB access, generated **per module**: `sqlc.yaml` has one `sql:` block per module, reading from `internal/modules/<module>/infrastructure/queries` and writing to `internal/modules/<module>/infrastructure/sqlc`. A single project-wide `sqlc` package would let any module import any other module's generated queries, breaking the module boundary. **Every new module must add its own `sql:` block** — otherwise its queries never get generated.
- Use `database/sql` with the MySQL driver for the connection.
- Do not use GORM by default. GORM may be used only when the user explicitly asks.
- Do not use GORM AutoMigrate or ORM-based schema generation.
- Do not create cross-module ORM relations, preloads, associations, or foreign keys.

## Root commands (Go)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:web": "npm run dev -w apps/web",
    "dev:api": "cd apps/api && air",
    "build:web": "npm run build -w apps/web",
    "build:api": "cd apps/api && go build -o ../../dist/api ./cmd/server",
    "migrate:up": "node scripts/migrate.mjs up",
    "migrate:down": "node scripts/migrate.mjs down 1",
    "migrate:create": "cd apps/api && migrate create -ext sql -dir migrations",
    "sqlc:generate": "node scripts/sqlc.mjs"
  }
}
```

## Watcher: `apps/api/.air.toml`

`npm run dev:api` must run `cd apps/api && air`. Install air from its current module path
(the old `cosmtrek/air` path is deprecated) and keep it recent — since v1.6x air stops the
running binary before rebuilding on Windows, which otherwise locks the `.exe` and fails the
rebuild:

```bash
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest   # lands in $(go env GOPATH)/bin — put that on PATH
```

Always create `.air.toml`:

```toml
root = "."
tmp_dir = "tmp"

[build]
# Always ".exe", on every OS. Windows only runs files with an executable extension: a plain
# "tmp/main" builds fine but air cannot start it, so dev:api stops. macOS/Linux run
# "main.exe" just the same, so one committed config works for the whole team.
cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main.exe ./cmd/server"
bin = "./tmp/main.exe"
include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
exclude_dir = ["tmp", "vendor", "node_modules", "migrations"]

[log]
time = true

[misc]
clean_on_exit = true
```

Never drop the `.exe` from `cmd`/`bin` to make it "look Unix": air applies its Windows
`.exe` handling only to `full_bin`, not to `bin`, so on Windows a suffix-less binary is built
and then never runs — `npm run dev:api` just exits.

The scaffold creates everything above except the example module: a Go project starts with no
domain modules, and each one is built or installed from the module library through the
registry. The kernel files are copied from this skill's `scripts/templates/go/` — read them
there for the full code.

## The kernel

`internal/config`, `database`, `kernel`, `server`, and `shared/` are the **kernel**: the stable
surface every module — hand-written or from the module library — is built against.

- **`kernel.Deps`** (`Config`, `DB`, `Log`, `Auth`, `Authz`, `Jobs`, `Audit`) is what a module's `New` receives.
  A module keeps what it needs and never reaches for globals.
- **`Deps.Auth`** is the one kernel-level port: authentication. A module guards a handler with
  `d.Auth.Require(h)` and reads the signed-in user with `d.Auth.UserID(r.Context())`; the
  composition root fills the slot with `d.Auth.Provide(...)` from whichever module does auth.
  It lives in the kernel rather than in each module's `ports/` because nearly every module needs
  it — and `users` (guarded by auth) is also what `auth` needs, so per-module ports would make
  the two depend on each other. Until a provider is set, guarded routes answer 401.
- **`Deps.Authz`** is authorization, the second kernel-level port. A module **declares** the
  permissions it guards with in `New` — `d.Authz.Declare(kernel.Permission{Name: "users.manage",
  Module: "users", Description: "…"})`, named `<module>.<action>` — and guards with
  `d.Authz.Require("users.manage", h)` (401 without a session, 403 without the permission) or
  checks `d.Authz.Can(ctx, …)`. Guarding with an undeclared permission panics at startup. Without
  a provider the policy is "signed in = allowed", so a module works alone; an authorization
  module (the library's `rbac`) fills the slot with `d.Authz.Provide(...)` and reads the catalog
  from `d.Authz.Permissions()`. Permissions come from code; who holds them is data.
  `d.Authz.Covers(ctx, target)` asks whether the signed-in user holds every permission the target
  user holds — a module managing people checks it before touching someone else's account.
  Two modules declaring one name stop the API; a **production** server with declared
  permissions and no provider refuses to start (development only warns).
- **`Deps.Jobs`** runs scheduled background work: `d.Jobs.Every("<module>.<job>", interval, fn)`
  in `New`. One scheduler for the whole app — at most two jobs at once, a job never overlaps
  itself, a panic is logged — started after the registry and stopped after the HTTP server drains.
  Each run holds a MySQL named lock scoped to the app's database, so while a deploy briefly runs
  two containers a job still runs in one place. A job that works through rows still claims them
  (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) and is safe to repeat; a run may be cut short by shutdown. No queue
  service: a module that queues work keeps it in a table of its own (the library's `mailer`).
- **`Deps.Audit`** records who changed what: `d.Audit.Record(ctx, kernel.AuditEntry{Module,
  Action: "<thing>.<verb>", Target: "<type>:<id>", Summary, Data})` after the change is committed.
  The kernel adds the time, the signed-in user (or `Actor` when there is none yet), the client IP,
  and the request ID. Without a provider a record is a log line; an audit module (the library's
  `audit-log`) stores it — `d.Audit.Provide(...)`. A storage failure is logged, never returned.
  Never put secrets in `Data`.
- **`kernel.Version`** is the contract version a library module's `requires_kernel` (in its
  `module.json`) is checked against — see [Kernel versions](#kernel-versions) for when it moves.
- **Settings**: `config.Config` holds only what the kernel needs (`APP_ENV`, `APP_PORT`,
  `APP_NAME`, `DB_DSN`, `PUBLIC_DIR`). A module reads its own settings with `config.Get` or
  `config.Require` in its `New`, so a missing required value stops the API at startup.
- **Database**: `database.Open` sets `parseTime` (sqlc scans DATETIME into `time.Time`) without
  putting it in `DB_DSN`, which golang-migrate also reads. It does not dial — the API starts
  while MySQL is down, and `/readyz` answers 503 until it is reachable. That is what the image
  HEALTHCHECK and `deploy.sh` wait on.
- **Responses** go through `shared/response` only: `OK`, `Created`, `Paginated`, `Fail`, and
  `Error(w, r, err)`. A handler returns client errors as `*apperror.Error` (`BadRequest`,
  `NotFound`, `Validation`, …); any other error becomes a logged, generic 500, so internals
  never leak.
- **Input**: `request.DecodeJSON` (only `application/json` — 415 otherwise, which is what keeps
  a cookie session safe from forged cross-site posts; 1 MiB cap; unknown fields rejected; messages
  never echo Go internals), `request.PathInt64`, `request.ClientIP` (the real client behind
  nginx, from `TRUSTED_PROXIES`; `ClientIPFrom(ctx)` and `RequestID(ctx)` where only the context
  is at hand), `request.AllowTransfer(w, bytes)` (first thing in a handler that takes an upload
  or sends a file: the server's 30 s read / 60 s write timeouts are sized for API calls),
  `pagination.FromRequest`, and `validator.Validator`, which collects every field error into
  one 422.
- **Server**: `http.ServeMux` (method patterns such as `"GET /api/v1/orders/{id}"`), an unknown
  `/api/` path answers a JSON 404 instead of the SPA, and every request gets an `X-Request-ID`
  plus a logger carrying it and the client IP (`logger.From(r.Context())`). A state-changing
  `/api/` call a browser marks as coming from another site (`Sec-Fetch-Site`, or a foreign
  `Origin`) is refused with 403 — sibling subdomains share a "site" and its cookies, so this holds
  whatever domains the app runs on. Panics become a 500 envelope. `SIGTERM` (`docker stop`) drains
  in-flight requests for up to 25 s (inside the compose `stop_grace_period`).
- **Config**: `APP_ENV` must be `development` or `production`, and explicit in the container
  (the image sets `PUBLIC_DIR`); the database session runs in UTC whatever the host MySQL's time
  zone is. `Config.DataDir` (`DATA_DIR`) is the one folder the app writes to: `/app/data` in the
  image, mounted from `~/<slug>/data` on the server and backed up nightly; `data` (relative to
  `apps/api`) in development. A module keeps its files in `DataDir/<module>/` and checks in `New`
  that it can write there.
- `shared/apperror` is not named `errors` so it never shadows the standard library package.

### Kernel versions

`kernel.Version` (and `apps/web/src/shared/kernel.ts`) is the contract number a library module's
`requires_kernel` is checked against — as a minimum. Bump it whenever the kernel gains or changes
something a module may rely on — an addition included, since a module using it must be able to
refuse an older kernel. A change no module can notice (a comment, a clearer message) is not a
bump. Record what changed in the comment above `Version`. The skill's `check-drift.mjs` holds
the line: it fails when the three version numbers disagree or a contract file changed without a
decision (the skill's `AGENTS.md`).

**Compatibility.** A new kernel only adds: every module released for kernel N compiles and
behaves the same on N+1 — proven by running the library's testbed before the release. Removing
or changing something a module may rely on takes two kernels: one marks it deprecated (a doc
comment and a row here), a later one — declared breaking, with upgrade notes in its row —
removes it. Releases are tagged `monorepo-elcodelabs/kernel/v<N>.<R>`; the module library pins
one (its `kernel/`) and its module developers build on that alone.

| Version | Adds |
|---|---|
| 1 | `Deps` (`Config`, `DB`, `Log`, `Auth`), `shared/`, the module registries |
| 2 | `Deps.Authz` (`authz.go`); web: `shared/access.tsx` (`useCan`), `shared/app-events.ts`, `FrontendModule.provider`, `NavItem.permission`, `shared/kernel.ts` |
| 3 | web: `shared/lib/field-classes.ts` (`FIELD`), the Bingkai Navy primitives (`button` with `loading`, `input`, `card`, `dialog`), the `--animate-loader-slide` token in `theme.css`; Indonesian default messages in the kernel and starter pages |
| 4 | security and safety: `DecodeJSON` JSON-only (415) with safe messages; cross-site writes refused; `request.ClientIP` + `TRUSTED_PROXIES`; `Authorizer.Covers` / `d.Authz.Covers`; duplicate permission names and production-without-provider refused; explicit `APP_ENV`; UTC DB sessions; 25 s shutdown; tests for these in `server/` and `shared/request/`; web: route error and 404 pages, `http-client` sends cookies to a separate API origin |
| 5 | `Deps.Jobs` (`jobs.go`), `Deps.Audit` (`audit.go`), `request.RequestID` / `ClientIPFrom` / `AllowTransfer`, `Config.DataDir` and the `./data:/app/data` volume (compose, Dockerfile, deploy.sh), tests for jobs and audit; web: open slot names, the `profile:changed` app event |

A project scaffolded on an older kernel moves up by copying the new kernel files from this
skill's `scripts/templates/` (for 2: `internal/kernel/authz.go`, the `Authz` field in `Deps`,
its construction in `main.go`, and the web files above; for 3: `web/field-classes.ts`, the
`web/primitives/*`, and the `@theme` block of `web/theme.css`; for 4: `internal/shared/request/`,
`internal/server/`, `internal/kernel/authz.go`, `internal/config/config.go`,
`internal/database/database.go`, `cmd/server/main.go`, `.dockerignore`, the Dockerfile lines,
`deploy.sh`, and the web files `shared/components/feedback/RouteError.tsx`,
`app/routes/index.tsx`, `shared/services/http-client.ts` — an authorization provider must
implement `Covers`; for 5: `internal/kernel/jobs.go` and `audit.go`, the `Jobs`/`Audit` fields in
`Deps` and their construction, start, and stop in `main.go`, `request.go`, `middleware.go`,
`config.go` (`DataDir`), `database.go` (`Name`), the `volumes:` entry in the prod compose, the
`data/` step in `deploy.sh`, the Dockerfile's `/app/data`, the `.gitignore` line
`apps/api/data/`, and the web files `shared/composition.tsx` and `shared/app-events.ts`; on the
server, re-install `scripts/server/elcodelabs-backup.sh` with `APPS_ROOT` set so `data/` is
backed up), then raising both version numbers.

## Module contract and the registry

A module never imports another module (rule and rationale:
[backend-modular-monolith.md](backend-modular-monolith.md#ports-contracts-and-the-composition-root)).
It depends only on the kernel and its own packages. What it needs from outside is a port in its
own `ports/`; what it offers is its `contracts/`.

A module's package root (`internal/modules/<name>/<name>.module.go`) exposes:

```go
// New builds the module from kernel.Deps plus one argument per port it needs — all of
// them types from its OWN ports package. An error (e.g. a required setting is missing, read
// with config.Require) stops the API at startup.
func New(d *kernel.Deps, users ports.UserStore) (*Module, error)

// Routes mounts the module's HTTP handlers.
func (m *Module) Routes(mux *http.ServeMux)

// Client returns the module's public contract — only for a module that offers one.
func (m *Module) Client() contracts.UserClient
```

`internal/modules/` (package `modules`) is the **composition root**, the only package that
imports modules. `registry.go` builds each module and mounts its routes; a module that offers
a contract comes before the modules wired to it. Each connection gets a small adapter in its
own file beside the registry, named `adapter_<consumer>_<port>.go`:

```go
// internal/modules/adapter_auth_userstore.go
// authUserStore satisfies auth's UserStore port with the users module's client.
type authUserStore struct{ users userscontracts.UserClient }

func (a authUserStore) FindByEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (authports.User, error) {
	u, err := a.users.GetByEmail(ctx, email)
	if err != nil {
		return authports.User{}, err
	}
	return authports.User{ID: u.ID, Email: u.Email, PasswordHash: u.PasswordHash}, nil
}
```

```go
// internal/modules/registry.go
func Register(mux *http.ServeMux, d *kernel.Deps) error {
	// elco:modules:begin
	usersModule, err := users.New(d)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	usersModule.Routes(mux)
	authModule, err := auth.New(d, authUserStore{users: usersModule.Client()})
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	authModule.Routes(mux)
	d.Auth.Provide(authModule.Authenticator())
	// elco:modules:end
	return nil
}
```

- An adapter only maps fields and forwards the call — no business logic. Logic belongs in a
  module.
- A port can be satisfied by anything: another module's client through an adapter, or code the
  project writes itself (e.g. its own user table) — the consumer never knows which.
- Imports go between `// elco:imports:begin` and `// elco:imports:end`. Keep every `elco:*`
  marker: the module library's installer inserts lines between them, and generates the
  adapter when the provider is a library module it knows.

## Migrations and sqlc per module

- Migrations are **timestamp-versioned** (`npm run migrate:create -- <name>` →
  `<yyyymmddhhmmss>_<name>.up.sql`), so migrations added on two branches never collide. A
  module's migrations create only the tables it owns.
- `npm run migrate:up|down` runs the golang-migrate CLI (same version as in the image):
  `go install -tags mysql github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@v4.18.1`. The wrapper
  and the prod compose add `multiStatements=true`, so one migration file may hold several
  statements (a table and its seed rows). Keep `DB_DSN` free of `?params` — the app sets
  `parseTime` in code.
- The scaffold ships a no-op `<timestamp>_baseline` migration: golang-migrate fails `up` on an
  empty directory, which would break the first deploy.
- Each module adds its own `sql:` block to `sqlc.yaml`, between `# elco:sqlc:begin` and
  `# elco:sqlc:end`:

  ```yaml
    - engine: "mysql"
      schema: "migrations"
      queries: "internal/modules/order/infrastructure/queries"
      gen:
        go:
          package: "sqlc"
          out: "internal/modules/order/infrastructure/sqlc"
  ```

  sqlc refuses a config with no block at all ("no packages"), so `npm run sqlc:generate` runs
  through `scripts/sqlc.mjs`, which skips with a message until a module with queries is in.
